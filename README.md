I am current developing the scripts and hope to have everything out by tonight. For now this repository only contains the patched OpenSLL 1.1.1i Source. Currently I am working on an Install/Update patch script.

# Windows Installation From Source Code

 "Native" OpenSSL uses the Windows APIs directly at run time.
 To build a native OpenSSL you can either use:

 Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC) C compiler on the command line
  
 or
 
 MinGW cross compiler
 run on the GNU-like development environment MSYS2
 or run on Linux or Cygwin

 "Hosted" OpenSSL relies on an external POSIX compatibility layer
 for building (using GNU/Unix shell, compiler, and tools) and at run time.
 For this option you can use Cygwin.

 Visual C++ native builds, aka VC-*
 =====================================

 Requirement details
 -------------------

 In addition to the requirements and instructions listed in INSTALL.md,
 these are required as well:

 - Perl.
   Strawberry Perl, available from <http://strawberryperl.com/>
   Please read NOTES.PERL for more information, including the use of CPAN.
   An alternative is ActiveState Perl, <https://www.activestate.com/ActivePerl>
   for which you may need to explicitly build the Perl module Win32/Console.pm
   via <https://platform.activestate.com/ActiveState> and then download it.

 - Microsoft Visual C compiler.

 - Netwide Assembler (NASM), available from <https://www.nasm.us>
   Note that NASM is the only supported assembler.

 Quick start
 -----------

 1. Install Perl

 2. Install NASM

 3. Make sure both Perl and NASM are on your %PATH%

 4. Use Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt with administrative privileges,
    choosing one of its variants depending on the intended architecture.
    Or run "cmd" and execute "vcvarsall.bat" with one of the options x86,
    x86_amd64, x86_arm, x86_arm64, amd64, amd64_x86, amd64_arm, or amd64_arm64.
    This sets up the environment variables needed for nmake.exe, cl.exe, etc.
    See also
    <https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/build/building-on-the-command-line>

 5. From the root of the OpenSSL source directory enter
    perl Configure VC-WIN32    if you want 32-bit OpenSSL or
    perl Configure VC-WIN64A   if you want 64-bit OpenSSL or
    perl Configure             to let Configure figure out the platform

 6. nmake

 7. nmake test

 8. nmake install

 For the full installation instructions, or if anything goes wrong at any stage,
 check the INSTALL.md file.

 Installation directories
 ------------------------

 The default installation directories are derived from environment
 variables.

 For VC-WIN32, the following defaults are use:

     PREFIX:      %ProgramFiles(86)%\OpenSSL
     OPENSSLDIR:  %CommonProgramFiles(86)%\SSL

 For VC-WIN64, the following defaults are use:

     PREFIX:      %ProgramW6432%\OpenSSL
     OPENSSLDIR:  %CommonProgramW6432%\SSL

 Should those environment variables not exist (on a pure Win32
 installation for examples), these fallbacks are used:

     PREFIX:      %ProgramFiles%\OpenSSL
     OPENSSLDIR:  %CommonProgramFiles%\SSL

 ALSO NOTE that those directories are usually write protected, even if
 your account is in the Administrators group.  To work around that,
 start the command prompt by right-clicking on it and choosing "Run as
 Administrator" before running 'nmake install'.  The other solution
 is, of course, to choose a different set of directories by using
 --prefix and --openssldir when configuring.

 Special notes for Universal Windows Platform builds, aka VC-*-UWP
 --------------------------------------------------------------------

 - UWP targets only support building the static and dynamic libraries.

 - You should define the platform type to "uwp" and the target arch via
   "vcvarsall.bat" before you compile. For example, if you want to build
   "arm64" builds, you should run "vcvarsall.bat x86_arm64 uwp".
