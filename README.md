I am current developing the scripts and hope to have everything out by tonight. For now this repository only contains the patched OpenSLL 1.1.1i Source. Currently I am working on an Install/Update patch script.

Linux Patch Uploaded, to install just give permissions to the script by using the following

  sudo chmod +x Linux_Patched_Install_From_Source_Script

Run:

  sudo ./Linux_Patched_Install_From_Source_Script
